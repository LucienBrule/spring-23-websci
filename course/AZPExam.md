[Quiz 3: Azure specialization training and exam]{.c7 .c11}

[Due date: last day of the semester]{.c7}

[]{.c0}

[Last semester, we explored a lot of DevOps work, even if we did not
necessarily have a class on it. Everything you did with your Azure VMs
would be considered foundational DevOps work. DevOps on the Cloud is an
emerging baseline in IT, and one you are expected to know well.]{.c0}

[]{.c0}

[Now, it is time for you to begin to think about your potential DevOps
specializations and how the cloud plays an important role in those
specializations. We will return to our old friends at Microsoft and do
another free training and free certification with them to begin our
specialization journey.]{.c0}

[]{.c0}

You have three options for specialization for this assignment, of which
you must choose [one]{.c7}[:]{.c0}

1.  The AI expert. You are someone who wants to develop, deploy, and
    manage AI solutions in the cloud. This is a one-day (about 3 hours
    long) training, and you would then take the Azure AI Fundamentals
    (AI-900) exam:

3.  The Security expert. You are someone who wants to lead cloud-based
    security solutions deployment, including identity and access
    management, information protection, governance, intrusion detection,
    and incident response. This is a two-day (about 3 hours each day)
    training, and you would then take the Security, Compliance, and
    Identity Fundamentals (SC-900) exam:

[]{.c0}

Like last semester, you [must take the exam]{.c7} in order to receive
credit for this assignment. If you pass the exam, you automatically get
a 100% on this assignment regardless of your score. This grade will then
replace your lowest quiz grade. You still must take both quizzes no
matter what. Therefore, you must show me your score report with the
actual score on it. Please [do not]{.c7}[ take a photo of the score
report immediately after you take the test (the proctor might invalidate
your exam for that). After you take the exam, I can show you how to
access a copy of your score report if you don't remember. If you don't
want to use this to replace a quiz grade, you can instead opt for an
additional 2 points added onto your final grade at the end of the
semester.]{.c0}

[]{.c0}

[If you don't pass, then your grade on this assignment will not replace
anything. Essentially, it's a positive if you pass, and no harm if you
fail.]{.c0}

[]{.c0}

[If you don't complete this assignment, the best you can do for your
participation grade is 50%.]{.c0}

[]{.c0}

You also get a "free lab" for this assignment. I think I messed this
part up last semester. For this semester, the idea is that the[ "free
lab" week you will study for the exam during that week. So it is
recommended that you take your free lab in the week leading up to your
exam day. That way you can study for it and take it before you forget
everything you studied.]{.c0}

[]{.c0}

[As many of you know by now, you will need to do additional studying
above and beyond the required training videos to pass these exams.
They're not easy! You will probably need to work through the free
Microsoft learning modules for the exam you'd like to take. See the more
info page for your target exam and scroll down to the Learning Paths to
get started. Also use the additional study videos I've linked with each
exam. That's why you get a free lab for this--the time you would have
spent on a lab is now time you can spend learning about the Cloud.]{.c0}

[]{.c0}

I have already undergone these trainings[ for all three paths and taken
(and passed) all three of these certification exams. I can help you too.
The additional videos I linked for each exam are ones I actually used
when preparing for the exams.]{.c0}
