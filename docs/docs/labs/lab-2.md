# Lab 2 – APIs

**Due Date: 1/27 before class**

## Weather app

For this lab, you will be using OpenWeatherMap's API to create a web app that shows the weather at the user's current location. Start by connecting to the API and examining the information it provides. Make sure to check the HTTP response headers for any additional metadata that might be useful.

Once you have the weather data, think creatively and use other information provided by the API to fill out the rest of your app. You can check out the API documentation to see what other information is available, such as air quality, UV index, etc.

Here are some hints to get you started:

- Use HTML5 Geolocation to get the user's current location
- Pass the location parameters (latitude and longitude) to the API to get the weather data
- Populate the weather data in the HTML
- Use CSS transitions/animations to enhance the look and feel of the app

You will be graded on the following:

- Objective 1 – Processing API: 10
- Objective 2 – Displaying output: 10
- Creativity: 10
- Documentation/Readme: 20

## Why this lab?

The purpose of this lab is to get you to spend some time exploring how real-world APIs organize and offer data. Although you will only be using one API for this lab, you should take the opportunity to play around with different APIs (not necessarily weather APIs) and take notes on how data is organized. Consider why the data is organized in a particular way, what you like about the organization, and what you would change or remove.

Don't forget to check the HTTP response headers, as they may contain additional metadata!

**Your README file must include detailed descriptions of all the APIs you have examined this week (at least three, but more is better), including everything in those notes!**

This lab also gives you time to work on your project proposals, which are now due on 1/31.
