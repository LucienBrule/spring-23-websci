[Course Description ]{.c34 .c37 .c27 .c6}

[Building on the technology covered in Web Systems Development, students
will be exposed to current technologies, frameworks, and practices in
the area of Web development. Types of topics included will be
HTML5/CSS3, APIs for data, ]{.c0}[N]{.c8}[ode.js, MongoDB,
]{.c0}[Express.js]{.c8}[, and R. Methodology to be explored will be
application design, software versioning, and team development. Lab
intensive, this course is intended to complete a foundation for the
advanced courses in Data Science and Advanced Web Science. ]{.c0}

[Student Learning Outcomes ]{.c34 .c37 .c27 .c6}

[1. Students will demonstrate knowledge of the theoretical foundations
of Web Science. ]{.c0}

[2. Students will demonstrate knowledge of a broad range of technologies
that must be deployed to design and build web applications.]{.c0}

[3. Students will demonstrate knowledge of a broad range of issues that
must be addressed to design and build web applications. ]{.c0}

[4. Students will be able to investigate and present on topics in Web
Science at a    ]{.c0}[  ]{.c8}[level so that other students obtain an
understanding of the key issues.]{.c0}

[5. Students will develop team-building techniques in order to develop
and deploy real-world web applications. ]{.c0}

## [Attendance Policy]{.c28 .c27 .c6 .c34} {#h.mniw4xq56nyg .c49}

[Attendance is mandatory. Any absence must be communicated to the
instructor in advance.]{.c1}

## [Late Policy]{.c6 .c28} {#h.gzkyymh79yek .c49}

[One second to one week late: best you can do is 70%]{.c1}

[One week + one second to beginning of quiz 2 late: 50% max]{.c1}

[NOTHING ACCEPTED AFTER QUIZ 2!]{.c27}

[Academic Integrity ]{.c34 .c37 .c27 .c6}

[Student-teacher relationships are built on trust. For example, students
must trust that teachers have made appropriate decisions about the
structure and content of the courses they teach, and teachers must trust
that the assignments that students turn in are their own. Acts that
violate this trust undermine the educational ]{.c0}[process.]{.c8}

[The Rensselaer Handbook of Student Rights and Responsibilities and The
Graduate Student Supplement define various forms of Academic Dishonesty
and you should make yourself familiar with these. In this class, all
assignments that are turned in for a grade must represent the student's
own work. In cases where help was received, or teamwork was allowed, a
notation on the assignment should indicate your collaboration. ]{.c0}

[Submission of any assignment that is in violation of this policy will
result in a penalty of failure for the assignment in the first
violation; failure for the course for the second violation. ]{.c0}

[If you have any questions concerning this policy before submitting an
assignment, please ask for clarification.]{.c0}[ ]{.c31}
