# Lab 7

**Due**: 4/11 before class

## Part 1

Using the data you've collected until now, create at least two interesting visualizations using D3 (or some other visualization tool of your choice). Each visualization must be its own React component.

You can use the D3.js code on LMS as your starting point. However, you must use your data from your Mongo database rather than the data in the sample D3 project. How you go about getting that data into D3.js is up to you.

Creativity is all the interesting things you do with those visualizations.

If you already have two visualizations, help others.

## README.md

The usual: all your citations, a running worklog, where you got stuck, and how you got unstuck.
