# Lab 2 – APIs

**Due Date: 1/27 before class**

## Overview

In this lab, you will create a weather web app using OpenWeatherMap's API. The app will display the weather at the user's current location, and you can use additional information provided by the API to enhance the app's features.

## Objectives

1. Connect to the OpenWeatherMap API and examine the provided data.
2. Use HTML5 Geolocation to get the user's current location.
3. Pass the location parameters (latitude and longitude) to the API to get the weather data.
4. Display the weather data in the HTML.
5. Use CSS transitions/animations to improve the app's look and feel.
6. Explore at least three different APIs and document your findings in the README.md file.

## Guidelines

- Check the HTTP response headers for any additional metadata.
- Review the API documentation to see what other information is available, such as air quality, UV index, etc.
- Work on your project proposals, which are due on 1/31.

## Grading

- Objective 1 – Processing API: 10
- Objective 2 – Displaying output: 10
- Creativity: 10
- Documentation/Readme: 20

## Purpose

This lab aims to familiarize you with how real-world APIs organize and offer data. Examine the data organization in different APIs and consider the reasons behind it. Take notes on what you like and what you would change or remove.

Don't forget to check the HTTP response headers for additional metadata!

**Your README file must include detailed descriptions of all the APIs you have examined this week (at least three, but more is better), including everything in those notes!**
