# Lab 1 - Web Systems Review: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, JSON

**Due**: Friday, January 20, before class. Committing after the due date will result in the lab being marked late.

## Overview

This lab aims to get you back into the mindset of coding and possibly inspire ideas for your projects. You'll be creating a news ticker using pre-scraped data from various news sites, and displaying the news items in a responsive and visually appealing manner.

## Objectives

1. Scrape at least 200 news articles from various sources and save them in a single JSON (or XML) file.
2. Create a news ticker that displays five articles at a time and cycles through them no faster than once every three seconds.
3. Use CSS3 transitions and animations (or jQuery animations) to make the articles cycle through the ticker smoothly.
4. Make the site responsive and clean using Bootstrap, so it looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.
5. Write a README.md file that documents your thought process, challenges, and creativity throughout the development process.

## Guidelines

- Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only; PHP is not allowed.
- Design the app together as a group, then implement it individually.
- Host the site on your VM, or use XAMPP for local hosting.

## Tips

- Many news sites have an RSS feed, which provides XML descriptions of news articles. Free tools may be available to convert XML to JSON, making parsing easier.
- Run your finalized JSON file through a JSON linter, such as [https://jsonlint.com/](https://jsonlint.com/).
- Review JSON documentation at [https://json.org/](https://json.org/) and Bootstrap documentation at [https://getbootstrap.com/](https://getbootstrap.com/).
- Use Chrome or Firefox's dev tools to simulate mobile screen sizes and ensure responsive design.
- Remember to cite any tutorials or open source code used in your README.md file.
