## Student Learning Outcomes
1. Students will demonstrate knowledge of the theoretical foundations of Web Science.
2. Students will demonstrate knowledge of a broad range of technologies that must be deployed to design and build web applications.
3. Students will demonstrate knowledge of a broad range of issues that must be addressed to design and build web applications.
4. Students will be able to investigate and present on topics in Web Science at a level so that other students obtain an understanding of the key issues.
5. Students will develop team-building techniques in order to develop and deploy real-world web applications.

## Course Assessment Measures

| Assessment | Due Date | Learning Outcome #s |

| Project | 1 per semester | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 |
| Participation | Each class | 3, 4 |

## Grading Criteria
- Labs/Homework: 40%
  Each individual will submit one lab project per week, assigned the week prior.
- Group project: 30%
  Each group will design, implement, iterate on, and present a semester-long web application project.
- Quizzes: 20%
  Each individual will take two quizzes, one around the midpoint of the semester and the other after all lectures have been given.
- Participation: 10%
  Each individual will participate in class via the asking and answering of questions during lectures.

## Attendance Policy
Attendance is mandatory. Any absence must be communicated to the instructor in advance.

## Late Policy
- One second to one week late: best you can do is 70%
- One week + one second to beginning of quiz 2 late: 50% max
- NOTHING ACCEPTED AFTER QUIZ 2!

## Academic Integrity
Student-teacher relationships are built on trust. For example, students must trust that teachers have made appropriate decisions about the structure and content of the courses they teach, and teachers must trust that the assignments that students turn in are their own. Acts that violate this trust undermine the educational process.
The Rensselaer Handbook of Student Rights and Responsibilities and The Graduate Student Supplement define various forms of Academic Dishonesty and you should make yourself familiar with these. In this class, all assignments that are turned in for a grade must represent the student’s own work. In cases where help was received, or teamwork was allowed, a notation on the assignment should indicate your collaboration.
Submission of any assignment that is in violation of this policy will result in a penalty of failure for the assignment in the first violation; failure for the course for the second violation.
If you have any questions concerning this policy before submitting an assignment, please ask for clarification.
