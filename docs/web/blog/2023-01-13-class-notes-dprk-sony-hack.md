CIA Triad: Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability

## Characters:
- Park Jin Hyok
- Lazarus Group
- 2014 Sony Pictures Corp
- Steve Mosko (CEO)
- Amy Pascal (Chairman)

## Questions
1. Place yourself in all the different characters in this story. Could each character have done, if anything to change the overall outcome of the story? How do you envision that change and its ripple effects?
2. How would you have communicated all of this to the public. Would it have been different than what Sony did?
3. What recommendations might you offer Sony to prevent a recurrence?
4. What if anything does the behavior of the press/media tell us about our cultural reaction to cyber crime? Is that the cultural response we want?
5. Could something like this happen at RPI? Gather some OSINT on RPI

## Responses:
- I blame the CISO (Jason Spaltro), he said he wouldn't invest 10million to conserve 1 million. His view on security is flawed. 
- The executives, if they are anything like the hollywood execs I know are mostly not to blame for any of this, they're pretty clueless in general.
- I would have said jack shit to the public about this. 
- I would recommend keeping Mandiant on retainer, and paying them well. 
- I think the media's reaction is a reactionary one, made to stir the pot and bring attention to the issue. The addition of humor and light hearted ness about state sponsored cyber attacks probably isn't the best.
- Something like this did happen at RPI afaik. 
- I would come up with a better defence in depth strategy.
- I would purchase and install a Data Loss Prevention System and an Endpoint Detection and Response System.
- I would have a better understanding of the CIA triad and how to apply it to my organization.
