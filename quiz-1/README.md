# Quiz 1

How to run:

# Installing
```
cd frontend
yarn
cd ..
cd backend
yarn
cd ..

```

# Running

Open two terminals

Terminal 1, backend

```
cd backend 
PORT=3001 yarn start
```

Terminal 2, frontend

```
cd frontend
yarn start
```

The frontend will come up on http://localhost:5173/

The backend will be available at localhost:3001

There is a proxy module in the frontend that allows it to talk to the backend without making a cross origin call. 

You may need to run the same node version as me, 

this means that you should probably do:


```
nvm use 19.3.0
```

Why the frontend is creative. 

The search result card stack has roudned corners and a different background. 
The typsetting and typography are phenominal.
